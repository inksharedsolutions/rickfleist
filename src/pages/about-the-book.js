                                            The idea for “Just a Couple of Days” was an idea I’ve had for years. It wasn’t until I finally got help for my alcoholism that I was able to put it down on paper. It’s a fictional story of a miracle that happens to the character as a miracle had just happened in my life. It’s a story of hope! It tells us that as long as we have faith and there is breath in our bodies, we can rebuild our lives no matter how far down we have gone.
