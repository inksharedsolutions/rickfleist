                            My name is Rick. I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky. I drank and used drugs for over twenty yearsâ€”years that went by in a blur. Thanks to the grace of a power greater than myself and a wonderful facility called the Healing Place, I have been clean for thirteen years. I finished college, rejoined the human race, and continually learn and try to give to others what has been freely given to me.
